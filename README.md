### Description

This project, involving the transcription of J.-P. Jouanolou’s thesis, was conducted with his _authorization_. It was typeset in LATEX under the direction of Mateo Carmona, with the collaboration of Niels Borne, along with volunteers:

The transcription aims to be as faithful as possible to the original. Its edition is considered provisional, and we welcome any remarks, comments, and corrections.
